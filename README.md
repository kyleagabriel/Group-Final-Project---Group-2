Before/after performance report:
Performance of the webapp is much more complete in a sense that it is an end to end webapp for all 3 stakeholders. Customer can go all the way to checkout, while also tracking delivery. Seller and Installer have a main dashboard with simple analytics as well as their own necessary functions for their business operations.

Limitation:
1. Only 1 car model compatibility per product
2. Payment is mock. Not actually functional and connected to Gcash/Banks
3. Delivery function is randomized
